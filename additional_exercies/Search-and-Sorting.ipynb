The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.\"\n",

Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items.

    "```\n",
    "Bitonic Sort: According to rutgers.edu - Bitonic sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that can be run in parallel. It focuses on converting a random sequence of numbers into a bitonic sequence, one that monotonically increases, then decreases. Rotations of a bitonic sequence are also bitonic. More specifically, bitonic sort can be modelled as a type of sorting network. The initial unsorted sequence enters through input pipes, where a series of comparators switch two entries to be in either increasing or decreasing order. The algorithm, created by Ken Batcher in 1968, consists of two parts. First, the unsorted sequence is built into a bitonic sequence; then, the series is split multiple times into smaller sequences until the input is in sorted order.\n",

Two versions of the algorithm exist: a deterministic version that enumerates all permutations until it hits a sorted one, and a randomized version that randomly permutes its input.

    "```\n",
    "In computer science, heapsort (invented by J. W. J. Williams in 1964) is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it interactively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum. Although somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime. Heapsort is an in-place algorithm, but it is not a stable sort. A run of the heapsort algorithm sorting an array of randomly permuted values. In the first stage of the algorithm the array elements are reordered to satisfy the heap property. Before the actual sorting takes place, the heap tree structure is shown briefly for illustration.\n",
